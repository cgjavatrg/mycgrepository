Source Code Version Control System
---------------------------------------------------------
Dev1  -- login module entity,repository,service,controller

Dev2  -- flat module entity,repository,service,controller



We need to maintain
	-- who has developed source code at what time
	-- who has modifed a code
	-- keep source code per user
This is called Source code management
Source code , history must be stored and maintained at certain place and 
that will be called as version control system VCS

VCS are of two types

Centralized VCS
--------------------------

		Centralized Server ( Remote Repository )
			|	|
			|	|
		            Dev1        Dev2

If Server fails , then you will not have updated source code

Distributed VCS
---------------------

		Centralized Server ( Remote Repository )
			|		|
			|		|
		            Dev1       	           Dev2
		Local Repository          Local Repository

Even if Central server fails, peer will be having a copy of the source

Git is a Distributed VCS
For Local Repository , we are using Git
For Remote Repository , we are using Github
